## How to Play

Blackjack is a comparing card game between a player and dealer, where players do not compete against each other. It is played with one or more decks of 52 cards. The objective of the game is to beat the dealer in one of the following ways:

- Get 21 points on the player's first two cards (called a "blackjack"), without a dealer blackjack;
- Reach a final score higher than the dealer without exceeding 21; or
- Let the dealer draw additional cards until their hand exceeds 21.
